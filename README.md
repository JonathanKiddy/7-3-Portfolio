For this Project, I have chosen the inventory application, as I feel this type of application is quite pertinent considering the given the state of the supply chain, here in the US and globally. Having up to date inventories is critical to smoothly running a business, and nearly every business has inventory that must be accounted for and tracked. The chief function of this application is the straightforward process is that it tracks items in a customerâ€™s or small business's inventory, as this is ideally the target customer as larger corporations will have invested in their own inventory system, but as the app grows, we should keep an eye on larger market shares by capturing those larger business. This app was developed with API 33, which requires devices to run Android 5.0 or greater, which accounts for a vast majority of Android devices, which is approximately 99.2 % of devices currently running android. However with my current issues with the HAXM in the APK testing was not able to accomplish much, and resorce issues are hendering the app development. Thankfully my code is sound soanilysing via the code shows a rather stable app.
